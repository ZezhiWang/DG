# DG

## Introduction
This branch is used during the training process to make RNN prototype.

## Notes
Once the repository is deployed locally, please remeber to make a folder named `data` and use it as a temporary place for the training data. An automation script is included and can be used to transfer the data there into local MongoDB.
